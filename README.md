# Atari XL/XE Attractor 256-byte intro

## Overview

This is the full assembler code for the Atari XL/XE Attractor 256-byte intro by Kane/Suspect.
It can be assembled using MADS and has been written using the Atari Atasm plugin for VS Code.

The original idea had been to iteratively converge several strands of pixels towards a moving 
attractor. As usual squeezing it into 256 bytes proved a challenge which resulted in something 
slightly different, but still interesting.
